EndsOfTheEarth,FrozenPines,WhenTheNightIsOver
"Oh, there's a river that winds on forever",Deep into the night,My one and only love
I'm gonna see where it leads,With the moonlight as my guide,I've been lonely long enough
"Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted",I go wander through the pines and make my way to nature's shrine,Will I find you when the night is over?
I'm gonna stand on the peak,And I look up to the sky,Tell me where did you go?
Out there's a land that time don't command,And I know you're still alive,I've been searching high and low
Wanna be the first to arrive,"But I wonder where you are, I call your name into the dark",I have only 'til the night is over
No time for ponderin' why I'm-a wanderin',"I wake up in the morning, oh, and I don't know where I've been","In every window, I pass"
Not while we're both still alive,All alone on a mountainside and I'm huddled in the wind,Your reflection in the glass
"To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?",And it feels like I've been away for an era but nothing has changed at all,Makes me wonder if my mind is going
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see,"And it feels like I've been with you, oh, but what did we do and where have you gone",Shadows shifting in the rain
"To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?",On the night you disappeared,Slowly driving me insane
"Well if you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee","Oh, if I had seen it clear","By the stars above, I know we were in love"
"Oh, there's an island where all things are silent",But a strange light in the sky was shining right into my eyes,I have only 'til the night is over
I'm gonna whistle a tune,There was no one else in sight,I feel the weather change
"Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured",Just the endless frozen pines,I hear the river say your name
I'm gonna count all the dunes,But I wonder all they know 'cause they don't die and they don't grow,I watch the birds fly by
"Out there's a world that calls for me, girl",I am ready to follow you even though I don't know where,I see an emerald in the sky
Headin' out into the unknown,I will wait in the night until you decide to take me there,Now how the trail has gone cold
Wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger,"'Cause I know I don't wanna stay here forever, it's time to be movin on",I don't know where else to go
Please don't say I'm goin' alone,Oh I don't want to be the only one living when all of my friends are gone,"And my time, I fear, is nearly over"
"To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?","I will be waiting for you, on the other side of the frozen pines",When the ocean drinks the sky
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see,"I'm gonna find a way through, there's another life beyond the line",And the city winks its eye
"To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?","I will be waiting for you, on the other side of the frozen pines","When the night is done, you'll vanish in the sun"
"Well If you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee","I'm gonna find a way through, there's another life beyond the line",Will I hold you when the night is over?
"I was a-ready to die for you, baby",,Am I lost inside my mind?
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay,,There's an emerald in the sky
What good is livin' a life you've been given,,I hear the river say your name
If all you do is stand in one place,,"By the stars above, I know we were in love"
I'm on a river that winds on forever,,I hear the river say your name
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin',,I have only 'til the night is over
Maybe I'm headin' to die but I'm still gonna try,,
I guess I'm goin' alone,,
